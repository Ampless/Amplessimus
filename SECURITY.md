# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently don't see a reason to support older versions and backport
security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.1.x+  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.1.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Just open a GitHub issue and, if you are talking about a critical
security issue, send an email containing that to `amplus@chrissx.de`.
