# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently don't see a reason to support older versions and backport
security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x+  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Just send an email to `ampless@chrissx.de`.
(we might get a good bugtracker soon)
